Use links to refer complete article and title to concise it.== Description ==Spread the news in shortest possible way. Use links to refer subjective data and title to concise it, a short excerpt of that news will be added with it to let user know what that news is about.Don't you hate it when you want to publish something new that you have recently heard or read somewhere and you don't have enough time to write about the same topic again? When you can complete your message in a single sentence then why to write the whole page without any sense ?For this, "Kush Micro News" comes to rescue. You just have to put title, little description of 1-2 lines and a reference link. Thats it!All this data will not be published as posts in your wordpress because of which Google will not point you out for incomplete/less content on pages.A separate table will be created while installing plugin which stores all your wordpress micro news. Advised to add in sidebar or small block, because thats how it is styled in css. No separate page will be created of micro news you are going to post, to avoid unnecessary cluttering of content.Updates Coming soon !How much better can a plugin be ?
